# MovieTrailerWebsite
Website to display a list of movies, box art imagery, and movie trailer URL
Welcome to the Movie Trailer Website project.

This was a project created for an Udacity course. 

The objective of this project was to create server-side code to store my favourite movies, display box art imagery, and a movie trailer URL upon clicking the movie. 

The HTML page is launched by running the python file entertainment_centre.py
